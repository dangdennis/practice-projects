### create a "choose your own rpg adventure"
- generate a character with stats, such as 
  - qualities: 
    - strength : how strong the character is
    - dexterity : how dextrous the character is
    - intelligence : how smart the character is
  - gold: starts at 0
  - hitpoints: starts at 20
  
- make a series of adventure objects. 
  - has a base text to tell the user what is happening
  - has a series of choices that can be made
  - has some choices that can only be made if the character has the appropriate stat at a high enough level
  - some choices result in one or more of the following: 
    - damage to the player
    - healing to the player
    - gold earned by the player
    - increase in stat
    - decrease in stat
    - decrease in gold by the player.  If the player doesn't have enough, another effect might happen
  - if the player gets below 0 hitpoints, they die and the game ends
