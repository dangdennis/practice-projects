### Blackjack

- Create a deck object to deal from
  - the deck object will have 52 card objects
  - each suite (Diamond, Heart, Club, Spades) should
    have a set of 14 card objects
    - e.g. A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K (Spade)
  
- Create a blackjack card game
  - If a player’s cards is greater than 21. 
    The player busts and game is over.
  
  - If a player's cards add up to exactly 21. 
    The player has blackjack and the game is over.
  
  - If a player’s cards add up to 21 or less,
    but she has already been dealt five cards,
    then the game is over, and they win.

  - Otherwise, the player can choose to get
    another card or stop playing.
