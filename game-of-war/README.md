# Game of War

- Start with one deck of cards
  - The deck should be split evenly between four players (each player receives a random assortment)
  - Player should be able to "flip" the top card of their pile and compare against the top card of the other three players.

- Player with highest number wins (you decide if Ace is high or low).
- Winner adds losers hand to the bottom of their deck. 

- If there is a tie for the highest number, those players each draw four cards from the top of their deck and compare the fourth card drawn
    - Winner takes all cards and adds them to the bottom of their deck.
    - If there is another tie, repeat the above until there is a clear winner.

- The game is won when one player has all of the cards.
